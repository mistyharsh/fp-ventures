# Lists

Lists do double duty in Haskell.
* A way to refer and process a collection or plurality of values
* Infinite series of values, usually generated by function, which allows them to act as a stream datatype (Read Rx.js here)

List definition:
```haskell
data [] a = [] | a : [a]
```
Operator `:` is infix operator **cons** short for **construct**.
