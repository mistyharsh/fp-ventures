# Haskell Basic types

## Sum Type
Bool is a sum type with two constructors. For now, itâ€™s enough to understand that sum type means or, or logical disjunction. We will look more closely at sum types in a later chapter.

## If Else in Haskell
Haskell doesn't have **if-else** **statement** but it does have **if-then-else** expression.

## Theory
In Haskell, there are six categories of entities that have names.
    * Term level: Term level is where your values live and is the code that executes when program is running
        Variables and Data Constructors
    * Type level: During compilation and static analysis
        Type variables, Type constructors and Typeclasses
    * Module level: Code organizations
        Name for module

In Haskell, you cannot create **untyped data**. Everything originates in a data constructor. Type systems are often problematic in many programming languages because they make life difficult due to:
    * Allow bad (not well-typed) programs to be written as type system is not coherent
    * Do not let us express many programs that should work.
    * Do not provide Haskell like REPL mechanism. Become slow, etc.

Just because you don't often declare type doesn't mean that Haskell gives a free hand. It infers types, aka, type inference.

Note: Symbol ```->``` is actually a type constructor for function. This works:
```haskell
:info (->)
data (->) t1 t2
```
This signifies that it takes t1 and returns t2. So every Haskell function takes exactly one argument and returns one value. This type has no data constructors. Thus **functions are values**.

A type signature can have multiple type constraints:
```haskell
(Num a, Num b) => a -> b -> b
(Ord a, Num a) => a -> Ordering
```
Here it represents conjunction or product.

## Polymorphism
In Haskell, type signatures may have three kinds of types:
    1. Concrete
    2. Constrained polymorphic
    3. Parametrically polymorphic

Book says this:
In Haskell, polymorphism divides into two categories:
    1. Parametric polymorphism
    2. Constrained polymorphic / Ad-hoc polymorphism (using typeclasses)

Wikipedia says this:
Three types of polymorphism
    1. Ad hoc polymorphism
        Function overloading, heterogeneous implementation
        Static /compile time polymorphism in OOP
    2. Parametric polymorphism
        Generic programming OOP,
        Just polymorphism in Functional programming
    3. Subtyping
        Just polymorphism in OOP, inheritance / interfaces, subtype polymorphism
        Dynamic / runtime polymorphism

After reading wikipedia, it is clear that book is wrong about Ad-hoc polymorphism.

## Declaring type signature
It is possible, though uncommon, to declare types locally with let and where clauses. Here is an example in supplement file.

Haskell type inference infers the most polymorphic type that works.
