# Introduction
Why should I need to translate rule into the language of the computer? The programs we wrote so far were very stylized.

We substitute a pattern and apply it to skeleton to get a new expression.

Pattern -> -> Rule -> -> Skeleton
  |                         |
  | Match                   |
  |                         |
Source Expression -> -> -> New Expression (Target)

Pattern matching is the process of building a new language and means of interpreting that language, a means of executing that language, where that language allows us to directly express these rules. And what we're going to do is instead of bringing the rules to the level of the computer by writing a program that is those rules in the computer's language, we're going to bring the computer to the level of us by writing a way by which the computer can understand rules of this sort.
