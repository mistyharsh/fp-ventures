## Recursive thinking
If I have an easy case that I know the answer to, just write it down. Otherwise, I'm going to try to reduce this problem to a simpler problem.

## Best program
Best program is often hard to synthesis, but being able to read it at this point should be easy.

Abstractions are developed so that program can be more easily written and more easily read.

## Higher order procedures
The fundamental premise is that every function/procedure should exactly do one thing and it should do it very well, otherwise you are doomed.
