# Introduction
To make a system robust, the key idea is to make system insensitive to small changes i.e. a small change in the problem should lead to only a small change in the solution.

There ought to be a continuity. The space of solutions ought to be continuous in this space of problems.

Instead of solving a particular problem at every level of decomposition of the problem at the subproblems, where you solve the class of problems, which are a neighborhood of the particular problem that you're trying to solve.

The way you do that is by producing a language at that level of detail in which the solutions to that class of problems is representable in that language.

Therefor when you make more changes to the problem you're trying to solve, you generally have to make only small local changes to the solution you've constructed becasuse at the level of detail you're working, there's a language where you can express the various solutions to alternate problems of the same type.
