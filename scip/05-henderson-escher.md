# Introduction
Lots of things that people use in the computer are not closed. Meaning there is no closure. Closures are essential building blocks that allow us to build complexity. They achieve encapsulation.

Forming arrays in Basic and Fortran is not a closed operation, because you can make an array of numbers but not not an arrays of arrays.

When looking at means of combination, you should be asking yourself whether things are closed under that means of combination.

## List in Lisp
List can be represented using pair of pairs or sequence of pairs. Lisp provides a syntactic sugar to construct a list.

```
(DEFINE 1-TO-4 (LIST 1 2 3 4))
```
